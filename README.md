# 🧹 Basic End-User Application  
## 💬 Quote Estimator App

### 🧠 Project Overview
This project was created for a future business idea — an office cleaning service I hope to launch one day under my LLC.  
As demand grows in the cleaning industry, I wanted to build something that brings **convenience and automation** to clients and crews.

The **Quote Estimator App** is a simple web-based tool where users can:
- Enter **square footage**
- Choose a **service type** (Deep Clean, Move-Out, Eco-Boost, etc.)
- Set **service frequency**
- Instantly receive a **price estimate**
- Optionally **book** an available service slot  

This tool could help clients get quick quotes and crews stay organized with real-time scheduling.

### 🧰 Purpose
This is a **beginner-level data and app development project**, built to practice:
- End-user design thinking  
- Data input and processing  
- Automation of quotes and schedules  

It’s an ongoing learning project — functional, but still improving as I grow as a **young and ambitious data analyst**.

### 💡 Notes
While simple, this project represents my **current best work ** and reflects my **progress in analytics, deveploment, and problem-solving**.

*Created by a beginner analyst with big ambitions and clean data energy ✨*
